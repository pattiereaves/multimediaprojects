The elections ahead will set records for turnout and spending. Will the elver gold rush continue, and will the lobster continue to feed the country and Maine&rsquo;s coffers? The youth movement in Bangor government should herald a new era of creativity, while Maine&rsquo;s economy slowly grows and efforts to stem Maine&rsquo;s brain drain takes hold. A new visionary for University of Maine sports will be appointed, and our state&rsquo;s Olympians will go for gold in Sochi. 2014, we&rsquo;re glad you&rsquo;re here. Let&rsquo;s get to it.</p>"
