Welcome to the README!!! :D

If you're seeing this, you yeoman'ed up yourself a tasty fresh template
for a new BDN app. Hot sauce.

So there is some stuff you gotta do to finish setting thsi puppy up.

1. Go to app/data/chapters.json and plugin in the public facing URL for the Google Doc you're working off. BTW you can make multiple chapters with multiple 
doc urls if that's your style. Check out the Good Life Project to see how 
that's parsed together with the URL.

2. Once you've filled in all that stuff, run importer/importer.php. That's gonna turn that Google Doc into a tasty JSON file.

3. Do `grunt serve` from this directory. 

4. Before you launch, don't forget to update the meta information in index.html and the analytics tags at the bottom.

TODO
- The serve:dist is not copying the photos correctly. And the photos its crunching are still huge.
- Styles == uuuuugly. Can the defaults be a little nicer?
- Clean up cruft in the main.js file
- fix the navbar styles
